# Slack Agent SDK

The Slack Agent SDK is a Node.js library that simplifies the process of creating and deploying AI-powered Slack bots. The SDK provides a set of utilities and tools to help developers build and deploy AI agents that can interact with users in Slack workspaces.

## Overview

The Slack Agent SDK is designed to streamline the development and deployment of AI-powered Slack bots by providing a set of pre-built components and features that can be easily integrated into existing projects. It abstracts away the complexity of interacting with the Slack API and handling user messages, allowing developers to focus on building conversational AI capabilities and custom workflows.

It's primary design is to support multiple agents in a single workspace, each with its own set of capabilities and features. This allows developers to create specialized agents for different tasks or use cases, such as customer support, task automation, information retrieval, and more. The agents can be invited into Slack channels or direct messages, where they can interact with users and each other to perform various actions and tasks. It leverages the Agent Swarm pattern to enable multiple agents to collaborate and coordinate their activities, making it easy to build complex conversational workflows and automate tasks across different agents.

## Features

- **Agent Management**: The SDK provides utilities for managing multiple agents in a single workspace, including creating, updating, and deleting agents, as well as handling agent events and messages.

- **Agent Handoff**: The SDK supports handing off the conversation to another agent or external service, allowing agents to collaborate and delegate tasks to each other.

- **Communication Threads**: The Agents can start conversational threads to interact with each other and make requests via Slack.

- **Agent Swarm**: The SDK implements the Agent Swarm pattern, enabling multiple agents to work together to achieve common goals and objectives.

- **Conversational AI**: The SDK includes support for integrating conversational AI capabilities, such as natural language understanding (NLU) and dialogue management, into agents to enable human-like interactions.

- **Task Automation**: The SDK provides tools for automating tasks and workflows within agents, allowing them to perform actions based on user requests or triggers.

- **Integration with Slack**: The SDK abstracts away the complexity of interacting with the Slack API, making it easy to send and receive messages, events, and data between agents and Slack workspaces.

- **Long running tasks**: The SDK leverages Vercel serverless functions to handle long running tasks, such as processing large datasets or executing complex workflows in the background and updating Slack once completed.
